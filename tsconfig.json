// This file is used to tell the App how to compile the .ts files and where to compile them down to.
// Here, it is saying to take all the files from the ./lib folder and compile them down to commonjs
// into the ./dist folder. Only lib files of file type .ts should be compiled, and the node_modules
// should not be compiled.
